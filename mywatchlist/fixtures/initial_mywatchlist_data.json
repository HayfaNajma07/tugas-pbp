The scenes with the older brother were very funny. We watch quite a lot of cartoon style films as my youngest is ten. I would recommend this film to everyone, whether you have children or not. Like most cartoon movies there are subtle wording and scenes that will make adults laugh. Go out see this film, one of the best this year so far."

            "review": "The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense."

Miracle in cell no.7 is a heart-warming story about the relationship between a 6-year old girl and her mentally challenged father whose accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit. The characters look eccentric yet enchanting thanks to their mesmerizing performance. An immensely satisfying family drama that will leave most of its viewers with a smile on their face & tears in their eyes."

It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."

            "review": "The animation is really, really good, as expected from Pixar, but they wasted it by making their first film to completely break their mold by having a target audience. Pretty much every one of their movies attempts to be likable by all people of all ages, so I'm not sure why they did this, but the movie is solely targeted at preteen girls and no one else at all, and the plot is entirely focused on explaining puberty. The plot is weird and awkward, and every moment of screentime jumps back and forth between extremely cringey or mind-numbingly cliche. At least it has a consistent plot, so it's still better than Encanto, but not by much."

            "review": "Bigger, braver, more brutal, Joko Anwar sets new standard for Indonesian horror visual storytelling with each release of Pengabdi Setan's installment. But as usual with Joko, some parts work really well, others seem to be unfit in a 2-hour movie medium that are sometimes hard to ignore. But other than that, it's an excellent alternative for those suffering from Hollywood fatigue, thanks to all those homages towards 60's - 80's horror movies, the period where Hollywood still knew how to make movies, including horror/thriller."

Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence."
